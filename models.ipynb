      "I first read THE PROPHET in college back in the 60's. The book had a revival as did anything metaphysical in the turbulent 60's. It had a profound effect on me and became a book I always took with me. After graduation I joined the Peace Corps and during stressful training in country (Liberia) at times of illness and the night before I left, this book gave me great comfort. I read it before I married, just before and again after my children were born and again after two near fatal illnesses. I am always amazed that there is a chapter that reaches out to you, grabs you and offers both comfort and hope for the future.Gibran offers timeless insights and love with each word.

If he had the means to publish it a century or two earlier, he could have inspired a new religion.From the mouth of an old man about to sail away to a far away destination, we hear the wisdom of life and all important aspects of it.  It is a messege.  A guide book.  A Sufi sermon. Much is put in perspective without any hint of a dogma.  There is much that hints at his birth place, Lebanon where many of the old prophets walked the Earth and where this book project first germinated most likely.Probably becuase it was written in English originally, the writing flows, it is pleasant to read, and the charcoal drawings of the author decorating the pages is a plus.

Recently a friend (who is 90) and I were talking about work and she said: &quot;work is love made visible,&quot; and told me it was from the Prophet.  I though that was so beautiful I got the book and was not disappointed.You see, if you have ideas and you do not realize them, then they are nothing, and if your ideas do not come from love and joy, then they are bitter and what they produce will be bitter, but if they flow from love and joy, then their realization will be love and joy, thus work is love made visible.He says it WAY better that I do and says much more in just a few paragraphs.

If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp.

      "This is one of the first (literary) books I recall reading. My mother kept a collection of Gibran's works that she often read. I was curious to see what attracted her, so I looked into them too ( I was either eight or nine  at the time). I believe that was my first taste of spirituality and seemed  at the time more relevant than what I was being force-fed by nuns in  catechism class. Rereading Gibran now, I'm struck by the notion that Hesse  must have been aware of these texts before he wrote Siddhartha. They  contain many of the same themes: No one else can guide you on your path.  You must select your own course. Preachers and prophets are a dime a dozen.  True wisdom comes from within.The prophet's teaching on love is  particularly relevant to me at this stage of my life:&quot;For even as  love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so  is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your  tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your  roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn  he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts  you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you  until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you  may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.&quot;Look into these  books. They may appear simplistic to the jaundiced eye, but they may also  provide the inspiration you need to see you through life's travails.\n",

      "A decade past, I knew very little about the writer/artist/poet/prophet, Kahlil Gibran. I am happy to say, that today, I am well acquainted with his work. The Prophet was the first book I read written by Gibran, and ever since that first reading I have immersed myself in his extraordinarily consummate skill of exquisitely crafted words. To say the Prophet or any other writings by Kahlil Gibran is simply fine literature is to say the mysterious of the soul are mediocre. I recommend that if you have not touched upon any of Kahlil Gibran's books, that you consider the Prophet as a good start. You will not be disappointed. A few other extraordinary works of art by Gibran: The Voice Of The Master; The Beloved; Sand And Foam; The Broken Wings; Between Night And Morn; The Earth Gods; and one of my personal favorites, though not so much a \\\"story,\\\" but rather a collection of personal letters to dearly beloved friends: Kahlil Gibran: A Self-Portrait.\n",

      "The Prophet is Kahlil Gibran's best known work in the western world with over 25 million copies sold. It is said that Kahlil spent more than 20 years writing The Prophet and held onto the manuscript for 4 years before finally releasing it for publication. Kahlil referred to The Prophet as the \\\"strange little book\\\" or \\\"the little black book\\\" in reference to its cover. The working title of this strange little book was \\\"The Counsels\\\" - the final version consisting of 26 `verses'.In The Prophet the philosophy of East and West meet in a union unparalleled in the literature of the early 20th century. Kahlil acknowledged that he was inspired by a multitude of writers and that is evident throughout The Prophet. Most notably the visions of William Blake, who Kahlil referred to as \\\"the poet-prophet par-excellence\\\" (incidentally one of Kahlil's mentors the sculptor Rodin called Kahlil the 20th century Blake), The Prophet was also heavily influenced by the Bible, Buddhism, Hinduism, the English Romantics, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ameen Rihani, and Christian and Sufi mysticism.When The Prophet was first published the early 20th century critic Claude Bragdon wrote of its, \\\"extraordinary dramatic power, deep erudition, lightning-like intuition, lyrical lift and metrical mastery with which the message is presented, and the beauty, beauty, beauty, which permeates the entire pattern.\\\" Wow that's a powerful critique...and let's listen to his close friend and one of his biographers Mary Haskell who wrote to Kahlil after she received a copy of The Prophet:\\\"Beloved Kahlil, The Prophet came today, and it did more than realize my hopes. For it seemed in its compacted form to open yet further new doors of desire and imagination in me, and to create about itself the universe in nimbus......This book will be held as one of the treasures of English literature. And in our darkness we will open it to find ourselves again and the heaven and earth within ourselves. Generations will not exhaust it, but instead, generation after generation will find in the book what they would fain be - and it will be better loved as men grow riper and riper. It is the most loving book ever written.\\\"I can add little more than that...other than Haskell had a very good point.\n",

      "Gibran Khalil Gibran was born in 1883 in what is now Northern Lebanon.  In 1909 he went to Paris to study, but he did not like the strict education, and so he traveled, eventually moving to New York.  Gibran became both an artist and a writer, and in 1923 he published \\\"The Prophet\\\", which is generally considered to be his greatest work.  He died of cancer in a New York hospital at the very young age of 48.The Prophet is a story about Almustafa (The Prophet) who after living 12 years in Orphalese is about to depart aboard ship to return to his home.  Before he goes, a group of people stop him, and to them he teaches the secrets of life.  Gibran writes in a very poetic manner, and it is wonderful to read.\n",

There are few words per page, covering the sayings of a wise man as he speaks to those around him. There is a kind of poetry in the words, but not the kind that is difficult to understand. The insights were both familiar and refreshing. It made me reconsider my notions of all aspects of life, although it was less a spiritual revolution than a gentle awakening.I bought the hardcover. It is small and sits easily in one hand. The pages are made from a rich-feeling, textured paper that feels nice to the fingertips. And the text is printed in spacious and easy to read letters. Throughout the book are scattered drawings that Kahlil Gibran made. I like them. I feel they add to the experience of reading this book, although I can't quite put my finger on the reason.While spiritual, it does not, as far as I could tell, convey any beliefs specific to any religion or even assume a readily recognizable god. Gibran says, \\\"... the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks, than to the least of all the blades of grass.\\\" (pp 27-28)  The notion of god that emerges from these pages is of a pervasive connectedness or oneness with nature and the universe.\n",

At the time, I found it beautiful, but I couldn't understand it. That is because I hadn't experienced life.Selections from this book were read at my wedding.

This book will help you to break through them.This is a classic that will stand the mark of time such as the Bible has done. Kahlil Gibran is an old soul who speaks in a language that can be embraced by people of any faith.The book is filled with metaphors and parables.

When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.\\\"  G. K. Gibran, The ProphetThe Prophet:Gibran's best-known work, The Prophet, is a collection of poetic essays, which became more popular with the rise of American New Age movement during the 1960s. Since its first publication in 1923, The Prophet has never been out of print. It was translated into more than twenty languages, and became one of the twentieth century best selling books, in the United States. The Prophet evoked the journey of the Promeathian exile, he called Al Mustafa (the Chosen One, one of Islam's prophet favorite adjectives). Gibran added to the work, a separate work he had attached to the story of Al Mustafa. Gibran has later linked the roots of his poetic collection to a work he wrote as a teenager in Arabic.Quote from The Prophet, Self-knowledge:*Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.You would know in words that you have always known in thought.You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.*And it is well that you should.The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea; and the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.For self is a sea boundless and measureless.G. Khalil Gibran, 1883-1931:I encountered Gibran as a young kid, even before appreciating Arabic poetry. I was then amazed by the beauty of his art and the romance of his expression, in 'The Prophet.' I read him, later in Arabic, before I realized how the Lebanese emigrant poet has touched the Western hearts. Gibran's collection of early stories, parables and poetic prose, were written in Arabic before his works were translated into English, earning him the nickname 'the Shelly of the Orient.' Many Arabic speaking intelligentsia, including my dad thought he has qualified, before Naguib Mahfouz was elected, to have been the first Nobel Laureate Arabic writer !Classic Book Reviews:\\\"It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. --his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description \\\"divinely inspired.\\\"  Brian Bruya\\\"His power came from some great reservoir of spiritual life else it could not have been so universal and so potent, but the majesty and beauty of the language with which he clothed it were all his own.\\\"  Claude BragdonPROPHET: LIFE AND TIMES OF KAHLIL GIBRAN\n",

      "Okay I know that Gibhran is supposed to be corny and cliched and assosciated with the hippy movement of the 60's.It does not mean that he also isn't still relevant to anyone seeking answers to what life is about. The set up is simple - as a prophet takes his leave of the people with whom he has stayed for many years, he is asked a series of questions, \\\"tell us of friendship, of love, of work, of death\\\". And to each question the prophet provides an answer.For me the message that the prophet provides is that life is not easy and that the greatest joys can only be achieved by risking and enduring great sorrow.But that is only what I took from Gibran and his prophet.

      "_The Prophet_ is a short read (my copy checks in at just under 100 pages), but its berevity belies both the power and beauty of Gibran's words.  At its simplest, it is a discourse on the human condition: love, work, joy and sorrow, crime and punishment, reason and passion, Gibran runs the gamut of emotion and being, laying bare the paradox of who we are as human beings.  While the tone is somewhat mystical (which I didn't really care for), the sheer poetic beauty of his writing moved me.For example, in the chapter \\\"Love\\\", Gibran writes, \\\"... When love beckons to you, follow him, / Though his ways are hard and steep, / And when his wings enfold you yield to him, / Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. / And when he speaks to you believe in him, / ... For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.  Even as he is for you growth so is he for your pruning. ...\\\"  The contrast, vivid metaphor and beautiful images were stunning and left me with much to think and reflect on about my own life, and the choices I've made.  It would be going too far to say that, as a result of reading \\\"The Prophet\\\" I've had an epiphany or (to take it to a ridiculous conclusion) some sort of a conversion.  Rather it has caused me to consider on a philosophical level what it is to be human means to me, and how I have demonstrated my \\\"human-ness\\\" in my life.Part poetry, part philosophy, it is simultaneously thought-provoking and emotional.  Undeniably readers will have a visceral reaction (although, apparently given the reviews of some, not all reactions are positive.)  Highly recommended, if only to cause one to examine their own life.  After all, \\\"the unexamined life is not worth living.\\\"\n",

      "The Prophet is about a mysterious religious thinker who is about to leave for his native land.  Before he goes, many people have just one question to ask him.  In a very few words, he tells them his accumulated wisdom primarily in a nondenominational way.  The only exceptions come in the references to rebirth.  The essence of each brief lesson is that we have to step outside of our own perspective to see things in the way that God does and wants us to.Let me give you an example.  When someone transgresses either man's laws or God's laws, we tend to condemn the person harshly and focus on punishment.  This is like treating the person as though they have fallen below some level of what it is still to be human.  Yet no one does anything worse than what some person has done wrong before and will do wrong again.Surely, our reaction should still focus, like a Mother's, on the fundamental humanness of the person and our desire to have the person be a contributing, loving, and helpful part of our community.Another way to think about the lessons of The Prophet is to notice that nature loves a balance.  If we interfere with nature, nature overreacts in some new way that counters our interference.  This happens when we put too much phosphate into lakes.  Algae blooms expand exponentially to eat the phosphate.  These lessons help us to see the balance that is missing in our initial reaction.A good parallel can be found in the study of the brain.  Our initial reactions when frightened or threatened are focused in the oldest parts of the brain.  This part of the brain triggers strong chemicals to be released that engage us in &quot;fight or flight&quot; reactions that can save our lives in the near-term.  In the &quot;civilized&quot; world, we often have these reactions just to stress.  Gibran is helping us move to our highest level of consciousness by choosing our reactions, and selecting reactions that integrate all parts of our brains plus our near- and long-term best interests as individuals and as a community.Many Eastern religions encourage one to become free of the conscious mind, and that sense of objectivity is captured nicely here.  I have a feeling much like when meditating while I read The Prophet, because of its calming influence on my overreactive senses.I also think of this perspective like being on the Moon and observing the circumstances on Earth through a telescope.  With such extreme distance should come detachment from the ego, to permit good thinking.But none of these perspectives are directly suggested or alluded to.  The moral lessons are simply there, with the briefest possible examples to make them clear.  As such, they are masterpieces of good thinking, moral ethics, and fine communication.The answers are so brief and so profound that you will want to discuss them.  I suggest you select another member of your family, or a group of people from your house of worship.  The lessons are best explored by discussing tangible situations that you face every day.  Certainly, it is desirable and appropriate to consider the direct teachings of your religious heritage and beliefs in this connection.Whenever you feel overwhelmed, turn to the page in The Prophet that addresses your issue.  Like taking a warm bath, you will be soothed by the love for humanity in the answers Gibran provides.Before you speak, ask yourself who is about to speak for you and what do they want.\n",

      "I plan to buy 3 more copies from Amazon, for my departing son & distant friends.Last night, I made a mad dash to get a copy of this book, ten minutes before the book store closed; because I couldn't find my old one.  I had been trying unsuccessfully for weeks to send out an SOS to a life-long friend whose comforting presence I really needed, even if just by phone.  Long, sun-lit walks through my beautiful neighborhood lined with 100+ year old oaks, magnolias, elms, and maple trees, did not make me feel any better.  At home, the news is only reporting the political and ecomonic turmoil going on world-wide, or the Oscars; the latter which I could care less about.  It was a very sad and loney moment.Back in Miami I would naturally hit the beach, or watch the ocean from my balcony and forget the world.  So, in desperation, I jumped in my vehicle, hit the book store, and called on the wisdom of Mr. Gibran.  I sipped a glass of red, kicked back on my couch, and slowly read aloud each blessed passage on all the areas of life and the challenges they can present.  I don't know why, but this book always makes me cry at the beginning and smile at the end.  In little over an hour I'd read slowly through each page, and felt 100% better.On physical inspection, this would be the student slackers paradise book report choice.  But don't be so easily deceived, because this book packs more useful information than any 50-pound college textbook, without the endless verbage of a 1,000 page Russian novel.It is small, the paper of good weight and quality (the ones I always purchase, at least), the print is big and the illustrations done by Mr. Gibran are simple yet humana and divinical.  The words are brief and powerful, comforting and idiot-proof.  Perfect healing food for the love-starved yet attention-deficit crazy world we now live in.  I was first given this book by a friend, as a departing gift for a 7,000 land/sea voyage, back in 1983.I hope to be there for my friend should he ever need me.

      "Echoing the reviews of others - it is obvious that Gibran both was inspired by and inspired many of the great writers of all ages.  From Buddha to Coehlo, and countless others in between, there is a depth of truth and a veil of simplicity that, once lifted, opens the mind, heart and soul to universal wisdom.It is not hard to understand why Gibran was as popular in his day, and in the 1960's, as he was.  Covering the landscape from religion to love, Gibran bubbles up deep truths in the form of a farewell speech from the Prophet to the people of his city before he sets sail on a final journey.  The metaphors are numerous and the scale of depth is exceptional.The book itself is nearly 100 pages, but the content is not readable at any level rapidly.

      "These days, Kahlil Gibran's \\\"The Prophet\\\" often gets dismissed as \\\"hippie\\\" literature. Yet, this book had been a bestseller LONG before the 1960s. Originally published in 1923, it almost instantly became a hit and even did well through the Great Depression. Today, Gibran's claim to fame is being the third best-selling poet of our time, behind Shakespeare and Lao Tzu... and pretty much entirely based on sales of this book. When his publisher, Alfred Knopf was asked who the audience for the book was, he flippantly dismissed the question. \\\"It Must be a cult,\\\" he retorted.Yet there is no such cult. What's incredible is that there's absolutely no marketing hype behind the success of this book. Gibran himself is long gone. There is no political, religious, or commercial enterprise attached to his name bent on winning souls and/or profits. The Gibran estate has merely been licensing copies year after year in response to the demand - a demand fueled pretty much entirely by word-of-mouth and chance discovery. The fact is, the twenty-six poems in this book have a surprising and suprassing relevance, insight and compassion. Broken down into several topics (\\\"On Love\\\", \\\"On Work\\\", \\\"On Joy and Sorrow\\\", etc.) the book itself recounts the sermons of a fictional poet leaving behind the gift of knowledge before he leaves his homeland.I first found Gibran through a setting of his poem \\\"On Children\\\" by local Washington, D.C. singers Sweet Honey in the Rock on their album, \\\"Breaths.\\\"\\\"Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.\\\"At the time I was about to leave for college and eighteen years of living under my parent's roof had made me restless for autonomy. That poem eloquently expressed everything I was yearning to say to them in my hours of frustration and adolescent angst. It later proved to be a reference to turn to in times where I needed confidence to live an independent and fulfilling life, while still maintaining respect and compassion towards the parents who had raised me.I am not exaggerating when I say that the poems in this book have kept me grounded and sane throughout some of the most troubling times in my life. Our modern lives are ever hectic, stressful and busy - wrought with drama, frustration, depression, etc. The knowledge in these poems brings me back to a \\\"middle ground\\\" - there is a sage wisdom and clarity in the poems that has often been helpful for me in \\\"unwinding\\\" and coming back to earth. They bring me back to a place of clarity from whcih I can see my life from a wider perspective.Though Gibran himself was a Christian and despite the title and conceit of the book, this is not really a religious book. The insight in this book would be applicable to your life even if you are an atheist. What's more, the poetry is mostly imagistic. Do not expect the academic poetics of Gibran's contemporaries Eliot or Pound or even Frost. They are written with the aim of being accessible and immediate to the reader and rely mostly on clear metaphors and vivid imagery.Copies of \\\"The Prophet\\\" are not hard to come by. Perhaps check out the book's table of contexts either using Amazon's \\\"Search Inside\\\" feature or in your local bookstore and see if it addresses a problem or issue you are dealing with. That's a good a place as any to start with. Chances are, you will find something that speaks to you on some level.\n",

But when you first open to those sections that apply to you, and listen to the words as they roll off of your tongue and dance in your ears, well, shock is the only word for it.

      "The language is poetic, but it is not poetry.  It works as prose poetry, in fact some of the best in English.  That is probably because Gibran somewhat mimics the poetry of the King James Version.  Some phrases and turns and images are brilliant.That said, what is the point of this book?  There are some nice things.  \\\"Is not religion all deeds and all reflections....  Who can separate his faith from his actions....  Who can spread his hours before him, saying, 'This is for God and this is for myself; This for my soul, and this other for my body?'\\\"Good point.  There are several such nuggets.  But, you can tell why the hippie-set loved this book: it is spirituality devoid of religion.  Namely, this book can make you feel all \\\"cosmic\\\" without all that pesky Christian morality.  That bit quoted above, it is followed by: \\\"He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.\\\"Ah.  See what morals get you.  On crime and punishment, we get this \\\"It Takes a Village\\\" gem: \\\"And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.\\\"  See, crime is not the fault of the criminal, it is the fault of society.  \\\"The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked... Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured.\\\"  See, if you self-righteous rich folk didn't oppress the meek poor folk, they wouldn't have to commit crime.I wonder how the injured rape victim victimized her guilty rapist.Generally, the twin credos of \\\"The Prophet\\\" are (1) any path to God is the right path, and (2) if it feels good do it.(1)  Thus, the pluralistic relativism of lines like:\\\"Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'  Say not, 'I have found the path of the soul.' Say rather, 'I have met the soul walking upon my path.'\\\"Forget that Jesus said, \\\"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\\\"  (John 14:6, by the way.)  No, no, no.  Many willfully ignore that Jesus said such un-ecumenical things like this.  The hippie-Jesus thinks that there are many paths to God.  The whole \\\"one source, many wells\\\" philosophy.  Don't believe me?  Why do you think the folks at the Jesus Seminar blackballed this very verse (John 14:6)?  \\\"Our great, loving, hippie-Jesus believes that everyone comes to 'god' in his own way!  He would never say that!\\\"  Blackball.  (That last quotation wasn't an actual quote, by the way.)(2)  And, though the nature of the good and evil chapter is tempered by a sort-of \\\"love thy neighbor\\\" philosophy, it still defines \\\"good\\\" not as following Judaeo-Christian morals, or even a \\\"do unto others\\\" prescription, but \\\"You are good when you are one with yourself.\\\"If it feels good to you, do it.  Sure, Gibran later seems to warn against unbridled pleasure-seeking, \\\"Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom.  It is the blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit.\\\"  Later,  however, such hedonism is considered a path (\\\"a truth\\\") to God:\\\"Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and rebuked.  I would not judge or rebuke them.  I would have them seek.\\\"Thus the paradox of liberalism: the Prophet rebukes you for rebuking those hedons amongst you.  They are only on their path.  \\\"You are so wrong to tell them that they are wrong!\\\"  Ah, relativism!  The problem with unchecked hedonism (\\\"You are good when you are one with yourself,\\\" if you prefer) is that mankind always finds some inner reasoning to justify their evil actions.  Man always finds a way to make pleasure-at-any-cost, devoid of anything else, his god.I don't want to seem as if I am some stick in the mud, a prude, or an over-moralizing and self-righteous Christian.  Christian I am, and hedon I sometimes am.  I can get wheat from the chaff out of \\\"The Prophet.\\\"  There is much here that is good, and some of it is artfully written.  Some of Gibran's thoughts are even profound.  Still, there is much here that is bad, there is still some shuck on the ear, so to speak.  Sometimes you must take the wrong path which leads you to the right path, but there is just one right path, not several.  Gibran never seems to say that, and, since he was a Lebanese Christian, I find that sad.There is much here to lead you astray.I will not hold it against Gibran that \\\"The Prophet\\\" has inspired numerous imitations of lesser-poetic talent, sad purveyances of even fewer truths.  Yes, I am speaking of (amongst others) the trite, inane cacophonies of Paulo Coelho.And, for those reviewers and readers who think that \\\"The Prophet\\\" is the most poetic, most enlightening, most cosmically spiritual tome of all time: try reading the Psalms in the KJV with an open mind.(Yes.  I invented the word \\\"hedon.\\\"  \\\"Hedonist\\\" sounds like a philosophical school, as does \\\"epicurean.\\\"  The latter, too, is for an aesthete.  Let's say a hedon is a pleasure-seeker without the philosophy.  A hedon is an unsophisticate.  I probably made up that word too.)\n",

He stresses the importance of \\\"letting go\\\" rather than \\\"taking charge,\\\" whether it's in relationship to your children, conflict situations, or the end of your life.I did not find it necessary, however, to fully agree with this Eastern outlook to appreciate the book, both for its poetic beauty and for inspiring thoughts.

Some sections are insightful and very well written. On death, children, and love were my favorites. I'm not sure how novel these ideas were back in 1928 (?) when the book was first published, but they are nothing new today. Still, the flowery language is pretty, it's not overly long, and also it's probably one of those books that make you look cool when your reading it at a coffee shop.... so it's not all bad.This book was given to me by my dad who grew up in the 60's and 70's.

Anyone who would not consider this work a standard for healthy living, is simply simple-minded.  This book should be offered to all high school students as a guide in gaining perspective on what is really important in life.  I first read The Prophet about 10 years ago, and I typically read it about once a year, just to remind myself.  However, I gave my copy to my son who showed signs of being &quot;at risk&quot; at age 17.  I believe the book had a significant, positive impact on him, and he is now 20 and living a very responsible and balanced life.

      "A prophet has waited twelve years in a coastal town for the ship that will bear him back to his homeland, which he misses.Why he is there, why he is waiting, how he knows what he knows, and who he is is a mystery.  As he departs the townspeople gather to wish him well. A local seeress who knows him best asks him to share his wisdom so that it will endure for generations to come.So, he reveals his wisdom on love, birth, marriage, children, pain, talking, pleasure, death any so much more.It is a profound work, and here is his advice on marriage so you may judge for yourself:You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.You shall be together when white wings of death scatter your days.Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.But let there be spaces in your togetherness,And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.Love one another but make not a bond of love:Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.And stand together, yet not too near together:For the pillars of the temple stand apart,And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.Its not a little similar to theTao Te Ching: A New English Version (Perennial Classics)where a border guard recognises Lao Tzu, and asks him to share his wisdom as he goes into exile.  Written 2,500 years ago, and one of the most translated books in the world.  The Tao contains many principles you can use in your everyday life, and if you're not thinking in  ego based ways, your wisdom based thinking opens up..If you like one book, you will love the other, so I recommend both.  For the Tao, I recommend the Stephen Mitchell version.  Hope this was useful.\n",

While I don't always agree with Mr. Gibran philosophy for a subject, some are particularly moving; for me in particular his passage on Joy and Sorrow was borderline earth shaking with his explanation of the relationship of the two, describing to me why both can be so strong.Rating this one is extremely complex.  Some passages touch you and make you think about your life or what you have; others flow over you, whether discarded for future consumption is to be determined later.  Because I wasn't touched by all, I call this a very strong 4 star book and can easily see why lovers of poetry or philosophy could call this a 5 star book.  What I can say though is thank you Renee for exposing me to The Prophet.\n",

After skipping around the book and reading sections that immediately  pertained to me at that point, I cried, not out of sadness, but out of  enlightenment...Gibran wrote his experiences,and his thoughts on life, but  they are such detailed poetic accounts, it applies to everyone at some  time, his writings have layers, and therefore this book can be read many  times over, and each time a new understanding will come. &quot;Your pain is  the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding...&quot;\n",

      "Being an Atheist, it may seem strange to some people that this book holds any meaning for me, but I think that, despite the religious references, people from all walks of life will relate to the poetic prose of The Prophet.Kahlil Gibran has been greatly celebrated in several countries for the book's simple yet biting phrases. Any two sentences in this legacy of living can be made into a thought-altering quote.Gibran uses a prose style throughout. Short lines of words written as freestyle poetry create a rich medium to deliver his words.Each section has something poweful to say, but some of my favorites were those on Work, Giving, Children, Crime and Punishment, Freinds, Time, and of course Love.As oppposed to most books containing the word \\\"Prophet\\\" anywhere in the title, Gibran expresses life as something to be enjoyed and soaked in as many ways as possible. The book does not stress the punishment of sins, but to bask in pleasure and not look back. Decadence is not suggested, but the basic purpose of Gibran's legacy is to tell us that life is short and must be lived without regrets.It is a book that includes such beautiful metaphors and velvetty language that you are always sucked into reading \\\"just one more section.\\\" What makes the book work is not just the simple genius of the author's statements, but also the beauty of his words, the flow of his language.I hate to be like everyone else (in more instances than just this), but it does change you. It states what any prophecy should, and allows the religious aspects of the beliefs to take the backseat to the love of life and aspirations.Buy, read, and live by The Prophet's words.\n",

      "I can't think of a title fitting enough. What can you say about a book that you believe to be one-of-a-kind? I have yet to find a book that I can compare it to. I suppose I could at least explain why I find this book to be so unique.First of all this book covers most all of life's complex issues in the simplest fashion, and in that respect it is uncanny in presentation. Secondly and astonishingly the author portrays a story of a prophet speaking to his people, but I cannot be so shallow to think that I am reading a said story... I am not reading the said story--what is actually happening is that I am the listener and Kahlil Gibran is the prophet himself.  I strongly feel that if you the reader do not come away with this feeling yourself, you are probably reading some other book.I think what would do justice in this review is to explain some feelings you may get from a brief reading, in fact with that said, I can state with confidence that many readers will peruse only a few pages at a time because the content is overwhelming in its ability to provoke thought and feeling. You may feel at times that some all important life questions are being answered. You may feel regret  like I did,  I regret not having this book earlier in life to help me. I believe that a great many of you will feel amazed. It is truly amazing how such a short simple book can have such a profound impact on a person searching for answers to life's puzzles.There is a quote from the \\\"Urantia Book\\\" that is appropriate in closing this review. The quote helps to sum up one of the unexpected feelings I received from this incredible story, and that quote is.. \\\"The argumentative defense of any proposition is inversely proportional to the truth contained.\\\" ...and I give this quote because this book gives you the feeling that you are reading divine truth. I am a firm believer that if Kahlil Gibran is not a modern day prophet, no one is, and you too may come away with this belief because this is a story that really speaks to the heart of humanity. I cannot think of anyone who would not love this book.\n",

Years later, after the death of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;, at a viewing of a movie of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute;, Gibran rose to talk and proclaimed in tears an exalted station of `Abdu'l-Bah&aacute; and left the event weeping.

      "I recently read an article in The New Yorker Magazine about Kahlil Gibran, writer born in the middle east to Christian parents. Kahlil Gibran managed to immigrate to NYC with his mother and siblings.  Gibran's personal life and his early death, his exotic looks and ability to both write and paint is what attracted me to read his masterpiece \\\"The Prophet\\\".  It is a mystic story, written in verse, less than 100 ages long with a dozen fantastic paintings that remind of magical realism in painting.  The book is a manifest on how to live, love, work, dress, embrace joy and sorrow, accept righteousness and mankind far from perfection.  It is a book of duality that in the most beautiful language a young philosopher teaches the ways to live life.  No matter what world, culture, continent or country one comes from,this verse is universal.  If anything, this piece of work has compelled me to seek out other of Gibran's work.  I need to get into a mind of this wonderful thinker who himself led a very complicated and solitary life.  It has been a long time since I read anything as beautiful and touching as this piece of literature.\n",

      "I am almost 51 years old. When i was 18 and deeply conflicted, weighted down with the confusions that can only be so impossibly painful at that young age, my mother gave me a hardback copy of \\\"The Prophet\\\". I've carried it with through all these years as a treasured companion. It helped me make sense of the non-sense my life was back there in 1974, and has comforted me more then a couple times in the years since then, as well.Today i'm here at Amazon to buy the same book for my 19-year-old daughter. She's a bright, warm, funny, sweet girl who is undergoing no small amount of angst as her comfy girlhood world slips away.  Her friends have begun to scatter to the winds--some to jobs and some to college--and her own adult responsibilities loom ever taller.Why, she has asked me, why do i feel so sad? I have no reason to be so sad--but i am. Why?And my mind has flashed to:\\\"Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.And how else can it be?\\\"So i want this book for my wonderful daughter.

      "I am alive like you, and I am standing beside you.Close your eyes and look around, you will see me in front of you.~Gibran's words on his EpitaphThe Prophet captures the teachings of Kahlil Gibran in a comforting story that succinctly touches on everyday topics like love, giving, joy, sorrow, freedom, pain, teaching, friendship and beauty. Within each tiny chapter, profound moments can occur as we are given insight into unfamiliar territory, a place of thought not commonly existing in daily life but familiar to spiritual teachers.Kahlil Gibran magically explores the connection between sorrow and joy and how the deeper the sorrow you experience, the more joy you can contain. Talking becomes thoughts that can no longer \\\"dwell in the solitude of your heart\\\" so they \\\"live in your lips.\\\"As Almustafa waits for a ship to take him back to the isle of his birth, he climbs a hill outside the city walls and looks out to sea. When his \\\"ship arrives\\\" he is suddenly filled with regret, yet knows he must follow his destiny and return home.\\\"Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?\\\"The priests and priestesses ask him to remain in very poetic ways: \\\"Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory.\\\"Almustafa only cries and doesn't seem to speak until a woman named Almitra appears. She is a woman who believed in him and he seems to have great fondness for her. We are not given any insight into their relationship, but his respect for her is unquestioned. She understands he must leave, but asks him to give the city his wisdom. She promises they will pass this wisdom down through the generations.While viewing pictures of Bsharri in Northern Lebanon, the mountains and the mist are almost a unique doorway into Kahlil Gibran's mind. He lived in a lush region where cascading falls, rugged cliffs and cedar trees influenced his art and writing.We can imagine his thoughts of home and this book was actually first imagined when he wrote a short story as a teenager. A Bostonian poet, Josephine Peabody, caught Gibran's attention at an art exhibition and she later referred to him as \\\"her young prophet.\\\"  She also wrote poems about Gibran's life and how she imagined his life in Bsharri. His life is woven into his writing in the most beautiful ways. He names his book for a woman he loves and his writing is infused with spiritual teachings and influences from his journey from Lebanon to New York.The story has an unassuming plot, but the lessons are eternal and the ending is surprisingly tender. I was left with a sense of longing that is still drifting along with me like the mists of Bsharri. The Prophet is not just a book to read, it is a spiritual journey to experience. It may take three or more days to complete the reading of this tiny book. I could only read about a third at a time because it is saturated in wisdom and many of the chapters want to be read and read again, until they are absorbed into your soul and written on your heart.\\\"But if you love and must needs have desires,let these be your desires:To melt and be like a running brook thatsings its melody to the night.\\\" ~Kahlil Gibran~The Rebecca Review\n",

Everybody I knew in those days had to be able to discuss it intelligently or risk being thought to have a gap in our characters as people. A folk/ talking blues singer of that era (I forget who) referred to this book in a lyric:\\\"...a copy of Kahlil Gibran's 'The Prophet' with all the significant passages highlighted--the whole damn BOOK was highlited...\\\"In truth, the whole phenomenon was symptomatic of the societal immaturity of my generation as young adults. It taught us all sorts of theoretical concepts of human nature that were not necessarily reflective of the real world--consideration, the dignity of each person, peace, love, repudiation of prejudice--all of this in a world that anything but reflected such beliefs in Gibran's day. And except for the hippy-dippy pseudo-enlightenment we tried to cram down the world's throat in our day, our peculiar era was no better. We just used Gibran and other such philosophers to peer-pressure one another into self-defeating meekness. If someone you knew was erudite enough to understand philosophy but didn't have the moxie to stand up to people when he should, Gibran was the ideal way to make him a bona fide doormat and make him think he liked it. I won't even try to speculate how \\\"relevant\\\" Gibran is nowadays. From the perspective of a sadder but wiser man--or at least not quite as stupid--I give you this Sting lyric from the song \\\"Consider Me Gone\\\" for consideration:\\\"To search for perfectionIs all very wellBut to wait for HeavenIs to live here in Hell\\\"\n",

This little book is always on my desk and every now and I revisit it again and ruminate over the wisdom that Al Mustafa gives to the people of the city of Orphalese.As Al Mustafa prepares to leave Orphalese after 12 years, the seeress Almitra implores,\\\"Yet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us and give us of your truth.And we shall give it unto our children, and they unto their children, and it shall not perish.In your aloneness you have watched with our days, and in your wakefulness you have listened to the weeping and laughter of our sleep.Now therefore disclose us to ourselves, and tell us all that has been shown you of that which is between birth and death.\\\"...and thus begins the beautiful explanation of love, marriage, children, houses, clothes, teaching, talking, religion and many more.

      "I can never quite make up my mind on this book. I read it years ago and was also somewhat puzzled by it. Rereading it I feel vague inspiring feeling, and the other a kind of vague repulsion. I see many many readers are inspired by the work. I myself feel it to be a kind of sentimental popular mixture of Whitman and Zarathustra, but without the great lyric sweeping of the former or the fierce intellectual irony of the latter.I believe the most famous section of the work of twenty- six poetic essays is the one on 'Love\\\"Here is some of this:\\\"Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;For love is sufficient unto love.When you love you should not say, \\\"God is in my heart,\\\" but rather, I am in the heart of God.\\\"And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires: To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.To know the pain of too much tenderness.To be wounded by your own understanding of love;And to bleed willingly and joyfully.To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;To return home at eventide with gratitude;And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.I am reminded when I read this of Bellow's description of the healer in 'Seize the Day' Dr. Temkin. On the one hand he says and thinks that it is phony  , and on the other he hears certain things and says ' True , True.'.I must admit my reaction remains mixed. I do not feel it is really poetic truth of the highest value, but I do not feel it is without value either.\n",

There is insight and wisdom on every page. 25 years after someone first leant me a copy, it seems to have more relevance to life's fundamental challenges than ever.Kahlil Gibran tells the story of Almastafa's departure from the city of Orphalese. As he leaves, the prophet (Almastafa) shares his thoughts on just about every aspect of the human experience. \\\"Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding\\\", \\\"Work is love made visible\\\", \\\"And think not that you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course\\\".However \\\"The Prophet\\\" is much more than a few inspiring self-help quotes. More a case of some of the deepest Eastern wisdom, universally applicable to the human condition. Long may it continue to inspire countless numbers of people around the world.\n",

I have given copies to many friends, and recommended to others that they buy it and read it carefully.There is enormous wisdom in each chapter, especially given the materialistic and secular world in which we live - which often seems for many people to be devoid of meaning or any spiritual underpinnings.  Gibran cuts through to the beauty and essence of Life, and his words are just as profound today as when they were written in the early years of the last century.This book should be recommended reading for any young person who is old enough to wonder what Life is really all about.  Indeed, it can be picked up at any age, and it offers insights that are brilliant and beautifully written.I urge anyone, who is thinking about buying it, to do so.

      "\\\"Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'\\\"--Kahlil GibranAs you read, Gibran's poetry brings spiritual and visual beauty to life within you.  Gibran is justly famous for rich metaphors that brilliantly highlight the pursuit of Truth and Goodness amidst all the darkness and light of human nature.This is a book to read alone or with a partner, to give and receive, to go back to again and again.Note: the excerpts available in Amazon's \\\"Search This Book\\\" facility unfortunately do not do \\\"The Prophet\\\" justice, since only the book's introduction is included, whereas the wisdom does not begin unfolding until a bit later.  Therefore I've taken the liberty of including here another excerpt which more properly demonstrates the gentle power of Gibran's writing.---And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, \\\"Speak to us of Children.\\\"And he said:Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.You may give them your love but not your thoughts.For they have their own thoughts.You may house their bodies but not their souls,For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.\n",

      "A very short book, only 133 pages published in 1926. To be honest I have no idea why I downloaded this. I have a vague memory of listening to a radio programme on the author some time ago, which I found interesting, so it must have been that!  Gibran is described in Wikipedia as, 'the third best selling poet of all time, behind Shakespeare and Laozi.'The book is written in bible-esque so if you are not a fan of that or indeed of religion it may not be a book for you.  On the other hand and bearing in mind this was published in 1926 almost every passage can be related to every single one of us and our lives today.There are no chapter numbers in this short volume but they are defined by the questions asked of 'The Prophet' by the assembled town folk as he prepares to leave them, returning to his 'home'.MarriageChildrenGivingEating and DrinkingWorkJoy and SorrowCrime and PunishmentFreedomReason and PassionPainTeachingFriendshipGood and EvilPrayerPleasureReligionDeathSo many of the words written by Gibran over 80 years ago, must surely, if you are tempted to purchase this book, resonate with something in your life today and his simple but reasoning outlook will remind you to step back and reflect on how you look at life and maybe think that there is something that you can do to change, for the better, on how you interact with others and with yourself!I'm not saying that I have had a religious or moral epiphany while reading this book, I personally still have no idea whether I am an atheist, agnostic or just a plane old fence sitter waiting for something different or better to come along, if that is indeed possible.  I did write somewhere in regard to the Bible, and I suppose in the same tone the Koran would be included, that I look upon the former as a good novel and if only more people would read it (them) without the religious zealotry and bigotry surrounding it (them), the world would probably be a far better place for all humankind, but that aint gonna happen.  But that should not take away from the fact that there are important life lessons in these works that are as relevant today as they were when they were written, as Mr Gibran's words, I believe, fall firmly within that description.Enjoy.....Editing for Kindle: 4 out 5Reading Enjoyment: 5 out of 5Plot:Overall Rating: 5 out of 5Chapters:Page length: 133\n",

As graceful as Jesus' parables must have been when freshly spoken, without the distortion of time and culture and multiple translations.  The Prophet had been on my list of \\\"oh yeah, I've heard about it and probably should read it one day\\\" books.  A friend's recommendation bumped it from there into my Kindle.

      "I plan to buy this book,and a few others,that I had a long time ago. To write a better review I would need to refresh myself on Eastern or Middle Eastern mysticism;Persian more specifically,Sufism and also the background of Kahlil Gibran.What I can say is that these small stories or parables or fables are Zen-like; thought-provoking and instructive. I loved this book when I read it and I wrote one of my (still) best poems while I was in the state of mind this book put me in. (I'm positive it was just after I turned 16 because I have memories connected to reading it in my room with an open window and hearing a Friday night football game in the distance from the high school...and not wanting to go to another football game because I had to free my friend from the outside port-a-potty after my other friend thought she was being funny and held the door closed when the other girl was going to come out....and naturally my claustrophobic friend started screaming and freaking out. She did the same thing I would do.Anyone of any age can enjoy this book,I just wish I had a copy around so I could refresh my memory and do a more detailed review. Of course I'm sure I would have read it more than the one time I read it, if I did have the same copy I had when I was a teenager. I always read books I really like more than one time.This book and The Little Prince by Saint Exupery;Siddhartha,Demian and Steppenwolf (all by Herman Hesse) are books I read at the same time period and that I also don't have anymore,either because I gave my copy to someone;or,had bought another copy for myself and also gave that copy away, or,they just went the way of all things,as things go...in time (and my 16th birthday was quite awhile ago...sigh.... 16 has also \\\"gone the way of all things\\\"....but not completely!)Anyone who likes The Prophet (or any of the other titles I mentioned) can consider themselves lucky if they have a friend who has read,or who has one of these books on their bookshelves;or who has a friend that would also appreciate this type of literature. (It's  \\\"A Beatles Thing\\\". Not so much connected to The Beatles, but people who like the same type of music always like their friends more,when their friends like the same type of music that they like. Beatles, Zeppelin,Pink Floyd,Rob Zombie, Black Sabbath or Godsmack...Or Johann Sebastian Bach...writing or music,it's still art. And we just feel more comfortable with people who have interests or feelings or an intellect similar to our own. ....Aesthetic magnetism is a vibration more in tune with the spirit;and everyone is in love with their soul-mate(s)...to have common ground; or be in sympathy with one another on a deeper level than the common plane of the inescapable movements of the mundane.)....Anyone reading The Prophet,and finding themselves on common ground with the author,will find gratification,and will know exactly what I mean in what I wrote in this short review.\n",

      "The Prophet Almustafa waits in the city of Orphalese for his ship to take him home.  For twelve years he has loved, cried, laughed, taught, dreamt, and lived with strangers.  He is joyous when he sees the sails on the horizon.  &quot;Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and aloneness without regret?&quot;What can a poor man leave for those he has learned to love?  Almustafa walks through the city, across the sands, toward the shore; as he does, he pauses to answer the questions of the heart.  &quot;Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and thirst.&quot;His words will pass from generation to generation in Orphalese.  The metaphor is reality, for the wisdom of his celebration of life is as powerful today as it was when it was published in 1923.Some of my favorite passages are:Of Joy and Sorrow -- &quot;The deeper the sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.  Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?&quot;Of Giving -- &quot;You give but little when you give of your possessions.  It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.&quot;Of Reason and Passion -- &quot;Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.&quot;Of Time -- &quot;You would make a stream upon whose bank you would sit and watch its flowing.  Yet, the timeless in you is aware of life's timelessness.  And knows that yesterday is but today's memory and tomorrow is today's dream.&quot;Each phrase carries you from one thought to another.  The profoundness of his truth is not gleaned until the words are read many times.  The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran is extraordinary, and will always be one of my favorite books of philosophy, poetry, wisdom, mysticism, and prose.Victoria Tarrani\n",

      "Gibran's Prophet is the best example of how simple prose can be used to convey deep and powerful statement. As the name suggests, the book just recounts some sermons given by a prophet. The themes discussed include love, family, friendship, freedom, etc. This is one of those classsics that one must own and read every once in a while, for the wisdom in these words is bound to make every reader a better, completer person. It is a spiritual prose, full of deep insight and inspiration for one and all.Some qoutes that I particularly like:And ever it has been that love knows not his own depth until the hour of separation.When love beckons to you, follow him, though his ways are hard and steep.Work is love made visible.Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy can it contain.Your house is your larger body.And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than thier misdeeds.For reason, ruling alone is a force confining;And passion, unattended is a flame that burns to its own destruction.Your pain is breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.For self is a sea, boundless and measureless.For vision of one man lends not its wings to another man.In longing for your giant self lies your goodness and that longing is in all of you.Trust your dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.\n",

      "\\\"The Prophet\\\" is Almustafa, called \\\"the chosen and the beloved,\\\" who has lived twelve years in the foreign city of Orphalese, and is now waiting for the ship that is to come and take him back to the isle of his birth.  Just as the ship appears, all the men and women of the community, including the elders of the city and the priests and priestesses, come to say farewell.  They ask him to stay, but he refuses.  Then the local seeress named Almitra addresses him as \\\"Prophet of God\\\" and asks him to speak to them of love and then marriage.  After this, others ask him to speak of various subjects, some lofty such as children, giving, and joy and sorrow, and others more mundane, such as eating and drinking, work, houses, and buying and selling.  There are in fact a total of 26 short chapters in which \\\"the Prophet\\\" holds forth before he takes his leave.  Kahlil Gibran was born Gubran Khalil Gibran to a Maronite Catholic family in the historic town of Bsharri in modern-day Lebanon, then part of the Ottoman Empire. His mother Kamila was the daughter of a priest.  When his father was imprisoned for embezzlement, Kamila decided to follow her brother to the United States, settling in the South End of Boston, MA, then the second largest Lebanese-American community in the United States. Due to a mistake at school, he was registered as Kahlil.As a young man Gibran studied art and began a literary career.  His first book for the Alfred A. Knopf publishing company, was The Madman in 1918, a slim volume of aphorisms and parables written in a Biblical-like cadence somewhere between poetry and prose.  The Prophet is said to be an early example of \\\"inspirational fiction\\\" consisting of a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose.  The book became especially popular during the 1960s with the American counterculture and New Age movements.  Much of Gibran's writings seems based on Christianity, but his mysticism reveals a convergence of several other influences as well, including Islam, Sufism, Hinduism, and theosophy.  To illustrate the relativistic nature of Gibran's theology, \\\"the Prophet\\\" says, \\\"Say not, `I have found the truth,' but rather, `I have found a truth.'\\\"  Jesus said, \\\"You shall know THE truth\\\" (John 8:32), and, \\\"I am the way, THE truth, and the life\\\" (John 14:6).  Gibran followed The Prophet with The Garden of The Prophet, which narrates Almustafa's discussions with nine disciples following his return after an intervening absence and was published posthumously in 1933.  Gibran had died in New York City, NY, on April 10, 1931; the cause was determined to be cirrhosis of the liver and tuberculosis.I would never have gone out and purchased this book myself.  However, I have heard of it all my life.  It is supposed to be a classic and a \\\"spiritual masterpiece,\\\" so when I found it in my father's library after his death, I decided to keep it and read it.  My reaction is, \\\"Ugh.\\\"  As far as I am concerned, it is mostly pantheistic nonsense.  Someone might say, \\\"It's all Greek to me,\\\" but since I took two years of Greek in college, if it were \\\"all Greek\\\" I might be able to make some sense of it.  I'll just say it's all gobblety-gook to me.  The Chicago Post said that The Prophet \\\"brings to one's ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes.\\\"  Ecclesiastes I can understand; The Prophet I do not!  This doesn't mean that there's nothing good in it.  The ravings of a lunatic sometimes contain a kernel of truth.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  However, there is nothing of value that might be gained from The Prophet which can't be learned a whole lot better by simply reading the Bible.  Besides, ten of the twelve full-page drawings by the author are rather immodest and consist solely of nude figures.  Of course, this is not surprising when you read what \\\"the Prophet\\\" says about clothes.  \\\"Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.  And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.  Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment.\\\"  Oh, by the way, even as simply \\\"poetry\\\" it just doesn't do anything for me.  It is not a book that I would recommend to anyone under any circumstances.\n",
